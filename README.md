# meta_gin: Meta Framework of Gin

**NOTE: Please don't use this in production we are testing it.**

**NOTE: Structure of the projected is subjected to change util it reaches 1.0.0**

## Reason to develop:

```
As a lazy software engineer, I don't want to write the same code repeatedly, which gave rise to this creation.
```

## Consideration while developing this framework:

- developer should have full control of their project structure
- developer should use gin and gorm
- developer shouldn't need to write same CRUD again and again
- developer should focus on writing business logic than configuring
- less code ==  less bug

Please check example

### TODO:
- [ ] allow support to add custom middlewares
- [ ] allow support to add extend the CRUD by injecting custom logic
- [ ] make structure cleaner and less bloat
- [ ] use this framework and build demo project
