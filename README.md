# meta_gin: Meta Framework of Gin

## Reason to develop:

```
As a lazy software engineer, I don't want to write the same code repeatedly, which gave rise to this creation.
```

## Consideration while developing this framework:

- developer should have full control of their project structure
- developer should use gin and gorm
- developer shouldn't need to write same CRUD again and again
- developer should focus on writing business logic than configuring
- less code ==  less bug
---

## This much code for the CRUD üï∂Ô∏è


**NOTE: Please don't use this in production we are testing it.**

**NOTE: Structure is the projected is subjected to change util it reaches 1.0.0**

## Contribution

**HAPPY CODING!!! üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è**
